# FPGCAR
     A car game on an FPGA using verilog

It's not just a game, it's a piece of the story of two friends who wasted many hours in two weeks every Friday night making this little piece, we did it, it's not perfect, but it's real.
But, now the most important thing you need to know to see this game working on your alter fpga
mem_saida_seq.v is where the gamebase code are, working with vga_controller, all logic game render, movement and etc are in mem_saida_seq
Honestly, it's not difficult to understand most of the things we did, but maybe it was difficult to start doing them, I don't know, it took a bit of work for us.

Project carried out for the Digital Circuits course at the Federal University of Rec√¥ncavo da Bahia.
The project was based on a template provided by the professor. Some elements could be removed to optimize the system for faster performance.
However, since we worked with a tight schedule, we focused on completing only what was required.

Luwigi has worked on the most detailed aspects of the game, such as transparency, ratings, and the difficulty system. I took a more pragmatic approach, focusing on the overall project. 
However, these different ideas about the project have contributed to its success, and we achieved what we aimed for. 
I'll share Luigi's contact information along with mine, feel free to reach out if you need any help.
