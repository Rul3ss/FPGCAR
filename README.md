# FPGCAR
A car game on an FPGA using verilog

It's not just a game, it's a piece of the story of two friends who wasted many hours in two weeks every Friday night making this little piece, we did it, it's not perfect, but it's real.
But, now the most important thing you need to know to see this game working on your alter fpga
mem_saida_seq.v is where the gamebase code are, working with vga_controller, all logic game render, movement and etc are in mem_saida_seq
Honestly, it's not difficult to understand most of the things we did, but maybe it was difficult to start doing them, I don't know, it took a bit of work for us.
